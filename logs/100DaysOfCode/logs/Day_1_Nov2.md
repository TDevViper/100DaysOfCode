🧾 Day 1 — 2 Nov 2025 Progress
🧠 Reinforcement Learning Basics

Learned the core RL concepts — Agent, Environment, Action, State, Reward.

Understood how policy and value function guide agent behavior.

Difference between Supervised Learning vs Reinforcement Learning clear hua.

🧩 Next Goal: Implement “CartPole” environment using gymnasium (OpenAI Gym).

👁️ FaceID Project (Debugging)

Worked on FaceID using Kivy + OpenCV + TensorFlow.

Fixed import issues (numpy, tensorflow, texture errors).

Application now runs successfully with live camera feed.

⚙️ Next Step: Optimize FPS and add emotion detection integration.

💻 DSA Practice (C++)

Solved a frequency counting problem (maxFrequency) using unordered_map.

Analyzed 0ms optimized solutions and code structure.

DSA streak ✅ started strong.
