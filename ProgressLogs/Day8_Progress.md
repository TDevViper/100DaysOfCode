# 🚗 #100DaysOfCode — Day 8 Summary

## 🧠 Focus: Reinforcement Learning (Project — AutoDrive_RL_PPO)

✅ Trained a PPO-based self-driving car agent on **Google Colab GPU** using **Gymnasium (CarRacing-v3)**  
✅ Configured full RL pipeline: environment → Box2D → Stable-Baselines3 (PPO) → TensorBoard  
✅ Agent learned to steer, accelerate & brake autonomously  
✅ Mean reward ≈ **367**, proof of successful training  
✅ Rendered videos + logged training metrics
