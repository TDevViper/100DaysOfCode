# 💻 #100DaysOfCode — OOPs & Advanced Java (Day 6 Summary)

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered (Lab 26–30)

| No | Topic | Concept | Key Points / Learnings |
|----|--------|----------|------------------------|
| 26 | Mathematical Operations (Inheritance) | 🔹 Single Inheritance | - Parent class `AddSub` → child class `MulDiv` inherits data members.<br>- Used `super()` to call parent constructor.<br>- Demonstrates data reuse, code reusability, and hierarchical access. |
| 27 | Method Overloading (Sum Program) | 🔹 Compile-time Polymorphism | - Same method name `sum()` with different parameter types.<br>- Integer, Float & Default (no-args) versions.<br>- Method resolution at compile time. |
| 28 | Abstract Class (Shape Example) | 🔹 Abstraction + Implementation | - Abstract class `Shape` with abstract methods.<br>- Concrete subclass `Area` implements them.<br>- Hides implementation details, enforces method definitions. |
| 29 | Interface Implementation (Half Function) | 🔹 Interface + Encapsulation | - Interface `Function` → method `evaluate()`.<br>- Class `Half` implements logic to divide by 2.<br>- Demonstrates interface implementation + array processing. |
| 30 | Multiple Inheritance (Using Interfaces) | 🔹 Multiple Interface Implementation | - Interfaces `A` & `B`, class `C` implements both.<br>- Resolves diamond problem via interfaces.<br>- Shows how Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces. |

## ⚙️ Core OOP Concepts Practiced:
✅ Inheritance (single + multiple via interfaces)  
✅ Method Overloading (compile-time polymorphism)  
✅ Abstraction (abstract classes)  
✅ Interfaces & Implementation  
✅ Encapsulation (data & methods together)  
✅ Reusability and Modularity in Java classes

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Java supports only single inheritance with classes, but multiple inheritance via interfaces.  
- Method overloading happens within the same class, based on parameters — not return type.  
- Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods.  
- Interfaces provide 100% abstraction and act as contracts.  
- Using OOP principles makes your code cleaner, reusable, and scalable.

## 🚀 Mini 100DaysOfCode Note:
🗓️ **Day 6:** Completed OOPs Lab Exercises (26–30)  
Practiced Inheritance, Method Overloading, Abstraction, and Interfaces in Java.  
Built mini programs to understand reusability, polymorphism, and multiple inheritance logic.  
This session solidified my foundation in core Java OOP principles.
