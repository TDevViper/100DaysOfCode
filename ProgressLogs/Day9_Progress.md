# 🧠 #100DaysOfCode — Day 9 Summary

---

## ⚙️ DSA — Linked List Implementation (in C)

### ✅ What I Did:
- Implemented **Singly Linked List**
  - `insertAtHead()`
  - `insertAtTail()`
  - `deleteNode(position)`
  - `displayList()`
- Implemented **Doubly Linked List**
  - `insertAtEnd()`
  - `deleteAtPosition()`
  - `displayForward()` / `displayBackward()`

### 🧩 Concepts Reinforced:
- Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc()` / `free()`
- Pointer manipulation and traversal
- Understanding of `struct` and self-referential structures
- Reversing and searching operations in linked lists

### 💡 Key Learning:
> “Linked lists teach how memory is truly managed — and how each node is a small ecosystem of logic and pointers.”

## 🤖 AutoDrive_RL_PPO — Phase 2: Vision Upgrade

### ✅ What I Did:
- Created **Custom CNN Feature Extractor** for PPO
- Integrated **EvalCallback** for saving best model
- Started implementing **Reward Shaping**
  - Added small positive reward for staying centered
  - Added penalty for off-track or crashes
- Set up **TensorBoard** logging for advanced analysis

### 🧠 Outcome:
- PPO agent now starts learning smoother cornering
- Mean reward began improving beyond baseline (~367 → ~500+ expected)
- RL pipeline now modular and callback-friendly

## 💬 Reflection
> “Day 9 was about depth — mastering pointers in C and refining PPO vision in Python. Both required patience, debugging, and precision — the hallmark of a real engineer.”
