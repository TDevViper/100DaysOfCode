## #100DaysOfCode – Day 4 & 5 (Combined)

### 🗓️ Status:
- **Day 4** → Skipped (Rest / No coding)
- **Day 5** → Active coding & concept reinforcement

---

### 💻 Focus Areas:
1. **LeetCode Practice – Array Fundamentals**
   - Problem #26: *Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array*
   - Learned the **two-pointer technique** (`slow` & `fast` pointers)
   - Practiced in-place array modification
   - Understood concept of **sorted** vs **sorted & rotated** arrays

2. **C++ Revision**
   - Practiced loop logic & dry-running
   - Fixed logical bugs in nested loop thinking
   - Rewrote functions with proper pointer/index use

---

### 🔍 Concepts Revised
- Two-pointer approach (`i` for last unique, `j` for scanning)
- `vector` basics: passing by reference, `nums.size()`
- In-place updates for arrays
- Understanding of sorted + rotated arrays
- Syntax cleanup and debugging techniques

---

### ⚡ Key Takeaways
- Avoid unnecessary nested loops → focus on adjacent elements
- Always dry-run your code before debugging
- Sorted arrays = duplicates are adjacent
- Returning `i + 1` gives correct unique count
-Clean structure > long code
